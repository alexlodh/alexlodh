# About Me  

I am Alex, an 18-year-old gap year student exploring the intersection of financial tools and agentic AI. Despite delivering a strong set of A level results and meeting offers from top UK universities, I chose to spend a year focusing on gaining practical experience and learning real-world use cases for AI-driven automations. My academic background includes:  

- **A*AAB at A-level** in Economics, Mathematics, Politics, and Further Mathematics (respectively)  
- Currently resitting Mathematics to consolidate and deepen my quantitative foundations while applying them to practical projects.  

I am particularly interested in how agentic AI (together with conventional data science tools) can be applied to financial systemsâ€” ranging from personal finance automation to large-scale economic modelling and decision support. My initial exploration in this field focuses on building experimental systems that combine technical rigour with economic insight.

## Skills and Knowledge  

- **Quantitative Foundations**: Mathematics and Further Mathematics (A-level standard)  
- **Economics**: Strong academic grounding with focus on applied analysis.
- **Technical Skills**: surface-level knowledge of Python for data analysis (numpy, pandas), machine learning (scikit learn), AI and agentic AI (Langchain) ui (streamlit), and multiple other languages.

## Projects   
- [Intro to RAG](https://github.com/alexlodh/Intro_To_RAG/blob/main/README.md) - Project focused on exploring differences between workflows, AI Agents and Agentic AI through the medium of private equity news analysis
- [Gold vs Equities](https://github.com/alexlodh/Gold_vs_Equities/tree/main) - simple visual tool to compare performance of gold and equities over customisable timeframes, using streamlit UI elements and the yfinance API
